                    The documented history of sports goes back at least 3,000 years. 
                    In the beginning, sports often involved the preparation for war 
                    or training as a hunter, which explains why so many early games 
                    involved the throwing of spears, stakes, and rocks, and sparring 
                    one-on-one with opponents. With the first Olympic Games in 776 
                    BC—which included events such as foot and chariot races, wrestling, 
                    jumping, and discus and javelin throwing—the Ancient Greeks introduced 
                    formal sports to the world. The following by no means exhaustive 
                    list takes a look at the beginnings and evolution of some of 
                    today's most popular sporting pastimes.

                    Wrestling is regarded the oldest sports in the world and we have 
                    proof. The famous cave paintings in Lascaux, France, dating back 
                    to 15,300 years ago, depict wrestlers. So we can safely say, 
                    wrestling one the more popular sports of that time. In other 
                    countries such as Japan,  a papyrus fragment was found with 
                    wrestling instructions on it, dating somewhere between 100 and 
                    200 AD. Wrestling was often played to determine the strongest man in society!
